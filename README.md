# NLP

This repository is a collection of Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects that explore various techniques and models applied to text data, such as text classification, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, machine translation, and more. Each project is self-contained with its own dataset, model implementations, and documentation, making it easy to run and understand independently. Some projects may feature Jupyter notebooks for step-by-step walkthroughs of data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, while others provide Python scripts for efficient execution. All required dependencies can be installed via the `requirements.txt` file. To run a specific project, navigate to the respective project directory and follow the instructions provided in its README. This repository is designed to be both a learning resource and a practical guide for applying NLP techniques to real-world problems. Contributions are encouraged, and each projectâ€™s details, including the models, datasets, and performance metrics, can be found within their respective folders.
